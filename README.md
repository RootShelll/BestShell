## Usage Guide üìö <a name="usage"></a>

After installation, you can run any BestShell script directly from your terminal:

```bash
bestshell system-info
# or with the full path
~/BestShell/scripts/system-info.sh
```

Each script includes built-in help accessible with the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```bash
bestshell disk-analyzer --help
```

Common arguments and options across BestShell scripts:

- `-v, --verbose`: Detailed output with additional information
- `-q, --quiet`: Minimal output, useful for scripting
- `-o, --output [format]`: Output format (text, json, csv, etc.)
- `-c, --config [file]`: Use custom configuration file

## Practical Examples üéØ <a name="examples"></a>

Let's explore how to use some of the most popular BestShell scripts in real-world scenarios:

### System Health Check

```bash
bestshell system-info --health-check --report
```

This command runs a comprehensive system health check, analyzing CPU, memory, disk, and network performance, then generates a detailed report with recommendations.

### Smart File Organization

```bash
bestshell smart-rename "*.jpg" --pattern "vacation_{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}_{{counter}}.jpg" --sort-by date
```

This renames all JPG files in the current directory using a pattern that includes the creation date and a sequential counter, sorting files by date.

### Development Workflow

```bash
bestshell git-automator --interactive
```

Launches an interactive Git workflow assistant that guides you through common Git operations with intelligent suggestions based on your repository state.

## Advanced Techniques üß† <a name="advanced"></a>

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore these advanced capabilities:

### Scripting with BestShell

BestShell scripts can be used within your own shell scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run system check and save result
SYSTEM_STATUS=$(bestshell system-info --health-check --output json)

# Parse the JSON for critical issues
CRITICAL_ISSUES=$(echo $SYSTEM_STATUS | jq '.issues | select(.severity == "critical")')

# Take action based on findings
if [[ ! -z $CRITICAL_ISSUES ]]; then
  echo "Critical issues found, sending notification..."
  bestshell notify --urgent --message "System needs attention: $CRITICAL_ISSUES"
fi
```

### Custom Configurations

Create personalized configurations to adapt BestShell to your specific needs:

```bash
# Create a custom configuration
cat > ~/.bestshell/disk-analyzer.conf << EOF
{
  "exclude_dirs": ["/tmp", "/var/cache"],
  "alert_threshold": 85,
  "auto_cleanup": true,
  "cleanup_targets": ["*.tmp", "*.log", "*.cache"],
  "max_depth": 4,
  "display": "tree"
}
EOF

# Use the custom configuration
bestshell disk-analyzer --config ~/.bestshell/disk-analyzer.conf
```

### Integration with Other Tools

BestShell works seamlessly with other command-line tools:

```bash
# Pipe output to other tools
bestshell net-monitor --output csv | awk -F, '{sum+=$3} END {print "Total bandwidth: " sum/1024/1024 " MB"}'

# Use with watch for real-time monitoring
watch -n 5 "bestshell proc-monitor --top-cpu --count 10"

# Schedule with cron
echo "0 * * * * $(which bestshell) backup-wizard --quick ~/important-docs" | crontab -
```
